# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker

## Description
A map animation that displays the NYC (Manhattan) MTA bus locations in real-time. The data is sourced from the MTA public API called "MTA BusTime Developer API". This project focuses on refactoring the real-time bus tracker exercise provided by MIT xPro. This animation utilizes asynchronous code in the DOM with JSON data sourced from a public API.

## Installation
First, download all files within the repository and ensure that they are all located within the same directory. Then, open the 'index.html' file in your web browser (Google Chrome is recommended) and follow the on-screen instructions to view the real-time MTA bus locations in Manhattan.

## Roadmap
Additional features and functionality to add to this project for improvements could potentially include: distinctive color-coordinated highlighting of routes, general traffic metrics (i.e., passenger foot traffic, on-road traffic delays, etc.), specific data for certain travel route, and combined price estimates for total trip cost.
