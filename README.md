# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker

## Description
A map animation that displays the NYC (Manhattan) MTA bus locations in real-time. The data is sourced from the MTA public API called "MTA BusTime Developer API". This project focuses on refactoring the real-time bus tracker exercise provided by MIT xPro. This animation utilizes asynchronous code in the DOM with JSON data sourced from a public API.

## Installation
_**NOTE:** In order to run the "Real-Time-Bus-Tracker" animation, you must download/copy the 3 required files (`mapanimation.js`, `index.html`, and `styles.css`) & store all the files in the same local directory on your machine._
There are two ways to copy the repository files to your local system:
* Download the repository as a zip file to your local machine:  
  * Navigate to the GitHub repository's main page and click the green _'Code'_ button on the right side. 
  * In the menu pop-up, click _'Download ZIP'_. 
* Fork & Clone the GitHub repository to create a local copy:
  * Navigate to the GitHub repository's main page and click the green _'Code'_ button on the right side. In the menu pop-up under **'Clone'**, select your clone type (`HTTPS`, `SSH`, or `GitHub CLI`), and then click the button to copy the URL.
  * Open your system's command-line system (**Terminal** for Mac users). Use the `cd` command to navigate to the system location where you want the cloned repository to exist. In the command line, type `git clone [url]` with the copied URL to finish cloning the repository to your local system.

Once the zip file or cloned repository is copied onto your local system, locate and open the local directory. 

Open your web browser (Google Chrome is recommended), and drag and drop the `index.html` file into your browser window to run the live animation (or, right-click the _'index.html'_ file and select your browser from the _'Open With'_ command).

## How to Use
Follow the on-screen instructions to view the real-time MTA bus locations in Manhattan.

## Roadmap
Additional features and functionality to add to this project for improvements could potentially include: distinctive color-coordinated highlighting of routes, general traffic metrics (i.e., passenger foot traffic, on-road traffic delays, etc.), specific data for certain travel route, and combined price estimates for total trip cost.
